A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the most recently added item is the first one to be removed. A stack can be implemented in Go using a slice or a linked list. Here are the common methods used to implement a stack:

1.Push: Add an element to the top of the stack
2.Pop: Remove and return the element at the top of the stack
3.Peek: Return the element at the top of the stack without removing it
4.IsEmpty: Return a boolean indicating whether the stack is empty or not
